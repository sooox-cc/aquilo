# Aquilo
Light. Fast. Untouchable.

## What's This?
Aquilo is a privacy-first platform for communities, built on the [Hydraulisc](https://hydraulisc.net) ecosystem.
It provides text and media spaces without surveillance, tracking, or hidden data flows.
Aquilo is not designed for growth hacking, user profiling, or behavioral analytics — it exists to keep conversations light, fast, and untouchable.

Because when communities are no longer about coming together, what's the point in having them?
